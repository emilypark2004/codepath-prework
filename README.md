Codepath prework project - Introduction App

App Description

This app enables the user to input their first and last name as well as the name of the school he or she is attending in textboxes. The user is also presented with a segmented control bar that can be used to adjust the student's year, a stepper to indicate the number of pets he or she has, and an on-off toggle switch that can be turned on if the user wishes to have more pets, and off if the user doesn't wish for more pets. Additionally, a picture of a school logo is displayed at the top.  Upon clicking the "Introduce Self" button at the bottom of the screen, an introduction including the inputted information will appear on the user's screen.
